# Pixel-Level-Semantic-Segmentation

# This repository contains four proposed algorithmic pixel level segmentation approaches for ashlar wall depth maps.
# The following approaches are used and contained in the corresopnding jupyter notebook file titles:
# Gaussian wavelet segmentation (Order 1 and Order 4); Adaptive Thresholding; Mexican Hat wavelet segmentation (Ricker)
